# Tower-Of-Hanoi

Overview

The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that involves moving a stack of disks from one rod to another, following specific rules. This implementation demonstrates the use of recursion to solve the problem, effectively moving the disks while adhering to the constraints.

Key Rules of Towers of Hanoi

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or an empty rod.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
